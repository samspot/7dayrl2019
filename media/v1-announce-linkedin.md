Making a Game for 7-Day Roguelike Challenge 2019

# Body

This March, I took a week off work to participate in a Game Jam,  [The 7-Day Roguelike Challenge 2019](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2019).  In a Game Jam, developers do their best to finish a complete game in the alloted time, typically 3-7 days.  This was my first time participating in one so I thought carefully about my scope and decided the best way I could be successful was to leverage my professional experience with web development and agile principles.

For this project I stuck with what I new, minimizing the learning I would need during the 7 day time window.  I thought carefully about my MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and what was absolutely necessary vs. stretch goals.  I drew particular inspiration from this [article on how to make a roguelike](https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2018/10/how-to-make-a-roguelike/) which recommended that you "race to the fun" and then branch out your features later.

My entry is called Resident Evil RL and you can see the original 7 day version [here](https://samspot.itch.io/rerl).  I had a wonderful time on the project, and so I continued to add features and improve it for a 1.0 release that coincides with this blog post.  The [full version](https://samspot.itch.io/resident-evil-rl) is much improved, and I took the opportunity to learn and implement React and TypeScript, both of which I avoided originally to ease my learning curve.  

I am very pleased with the [judging results and feedback](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2019/rate/380420) that I received.  This project has been a real blessing for me and a dream come true.  I will continue making games and art in my spare time and I look forward to participating in another Game Jam.

## What is a Roguelike?

This game is from the Roguelike genre, which you may not have heard of before.  [Rogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rogue_(video_game)) is a dungeon crawling role playing game originally developed for the unix mainframe in 1980.  Software at the time had tight constraints on memory, and so Rogue utilized [procedural generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation) to make every play unique.  Experiences with Rogue and it's desendents were inspirational to many later game designers, and some notable examples of games inspired by Rogue are Nethack, Diablo, Spelunky, and The Binding of Isaac.  

Roguelike games are typically turn-based and feature procedural generation, high difficulty, and permanent death.  It's not unusual for player to play for many hours without every clearing the game successfully.  Many of these games use the letters of the alphabet instead of graphics, and so the designs are focused on deep gameplay instead of visuals.
