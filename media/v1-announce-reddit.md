# Body

Play as Nemesis and see if you can eliminate 5 members of the Special Tactics and Rescue Service,  S.T.A.R.S.  The T-Virus is your ally, giving you the power to infect any weakened enemy and take control of them.  

Resident Evil is a coffee-break roguelike where you try and get the highest score possible.  Allowing your character to die will reset your score to 0, so use every trick in the book to take your opponents down.

## About

Resident Evil RL is the updated version of [RERL](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2019/rate/380420), which I created for [7-Day Roguelike Challenge 2019](https://itch.io/jam/7drl-challenge-2019).

I've loved the series since I was a teenager playing the Director's Cut on the PS1, and so I've used PS1 aesthetics wherever possible.  I'd love to hear what you think of the game!
