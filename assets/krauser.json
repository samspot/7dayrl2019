    "bio": "Jack Krauser was an agent for the 3rd Organization during the War on Terror, and a supporter of Dr. Albert Wesker. Previously a soldier within USSOCOM known as 'Silverdax,' he was forced into retirement after a 2002 mission to South America with USSTRATCOM agent Leon S. Kennedy. During his employment within the 3rd Organization, Krauser took part in the infiltration of Los Iluminados to obtain a Plaga parasite. Krauser was killed in late 2004 by Ada Wong, who was on orders by her agency to steal the parasite.",
